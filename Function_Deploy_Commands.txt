Commands used to create build and deploy a function on OpenFaas:

1. Create a function directory, handler file, and templates folder:
   faas-cli new <function-name> --lang <language-choice>
      
2. Edit the handler file to hold the code that you would like

3. Edit the .yml function file to contain the configurations that you need
      - Make sure to set your gateway to localhost:8080 or 127.0.0.1.8080
      - Be sure to add this if if is a faas-flow function 
        environment_file:
            - flow.yml

4. In the templates folder execute this command if you function is based on faas-flow:
   faas template pull https://github.com/s8sg/faas-flow
   
3. Build the Function
   faas build -f <filename>.yml
      - for us this was stack.yml
   
4. Deploy the function:
   faas deploy -f <filename>.yml --gateway 127.0.0.1:8080
      - this will be the same file as in step 3. 
   
5. Go to the external IP of you VM instance and port 8080 and use the portal to invike your function
